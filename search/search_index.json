As stated in week 1 we assume one Hammam per district. Step one in the design is determining the location and the size of the Hammam. Combining the expected size and best locations is therefore the main structure of our flowchart, as shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1: Basic structure of the flowchart in week 2 Location Creating an Hammam in the camp will require some thinking about the location. Already in week 1 we defined the important points where the Hammam should be placed. Density and Walking distance being the most important ones. We created an algorythm to find the best spots for the Hammam, using previously described parameters. Density was calculated with the density map , loaded into the Image Sampler of Grasshopper. The inverse of Density overall means more space to use and less families to bribe/offer alternatives. Walking distance was determined as, the closer to the centre of a district, the better. Also the other attractionpoints have been taken in account. A grid was made for the entire camp and the algorythm gave a result for each point (the higher - better). Now we edited the \"point-system\" to give less results and make it dependend per district. This loop can be seen in the following GIF: Fig. 2: Feedback loop on the filtering of points within each district. The whole location finding can be summarized in the following flowchart. Fig. 3: Flowchart towards finding the locations Size Now we have a lot of possible locations, we need to know the size of the plot to compare with the location and make a PoR. Firstly we analysed the topography of \"Bathhouse\" and how they work, which resulted in some depth charts After reviewing the depth charts and layouts of the bathhouses and other hammam, we chose a \"standard\" Hammam to design with. Fig. 4: Layout and depth charts of several bathhouses For this Hammam we created a depth chart, which became imput for the Bubble Diagram, together with the needed rooms. Fig. 5: The bubble diagram working with random sizes Program of requirements To estimate the size 5 different historical hammam are analyzed. The Garineh Kohne, Golshan, Dorod, Chekneh and the Kaboli Hammam. The spaces of the mentioned hammams were separated into following functions: dressing room, corridors, hot house, outdoor pool and the subsidiary room. This way we could find out how much percentages of the total floor plan each function requires. This can be seen in the figure \u201crequired space per function analysis_percentages per function\u201d. Since the result is in %, it allows us to separate the estimated hammam size in its different functions and change the room sizes according to the different amount of visitors in each district. As a reference for the general hamam size we took the Zygeheimi Hammam as an example. It has a surface of 400 m2 and it can host 25 to 30 people per hour. This led to following Hammam size : Picture of gh table with hamam size. The design project: We try to derive the spatial and functional composition of the complex from analysing historical buildings the population. Since we can not find all the data we need we have to make some estimation, like for example 20% single parents. will be visitable 20 hours per day, 7 days per week, in which duration the all the habitats over 12 years old will be able to use the facilities once. if it is 400 m2 it can host max. 4200 (= 30x20x7) people per week so, we can have the ratio of 10,5 people per m2 (only for the hammam area) We estimate that 20% of the visitors are single parents and have to bring their kids to the childcare ( 2 kids per person ) - the size changes in each district according to the population The washing facilities are estimated to have around 20% of the hamam, and include already the entrance to the whole complex.

Also, optical connections are present, shown in the REL diagram. Fig. 6: Bubble Diagram of the program of requirements Fig. 7: REL Diagram of the program of requirements Combining Now we have some possible locations, but some are not viable to build the Hammam, mostly due to houses standing on the location. Choosing the location is hard to do parametricly, as the house cannot be loaded in. The GIF below shows the chosen location for the districts. We will further continue developing a Hammam in district 10. All locations are chosen to have the less amount of houses removed. Fig. 8: Feedback loop on the filtering of points within each district.

Enlarge","title":"Next steps"},{"location":"week3/","text":"Forming: Architectural design of the key building types This week is the first week of Forming, the next step in the building design. We will develop ways of going from space - shape. This is a process that can be done on many ways, both manual and computational. This weeks objective is to check these processes and try to get a basic map. The bubble diagram is the input for these processes, as we say this configuration of the rooms is optimal or at least close to the most functional layout of the building. In week 2 we created the expected flowchart for this week. Concluding, this week should be about reading into masonry techniques, some preparations for the brick making and going from space to shape. Masonry To eventually make the translation to a buildable adobe building, we need to look into masonry. Eventually this turned out to be a bit of a chicken-and-egg-problem, as the structures should influence the grid, but the grid should also influence the structures chosen. We decided that the shape, and therefore the grid, is the more important one. Nevertheless we also looked into different kinds of vaults, domes, bricks and sections. The main conclusions about roofs can be found in the following picture: Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes We realised that to achieve a builable building we have to read into these vaults and how they are constructed. Its not only about the end result, but it should also hold mid-construction. Reading into this is also very important. During one of our sessions we also discussed the possibility of digging into the ground to build. It has some good features, shown in Fig 2 . Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes Shape To go from space to shape several paths can be taken to get to a shape and mesh. Several discussions have taken place to get to a basic floorplan and how to get there. This will show some experimenting we did this week to get into designing the hammam. The first approach we tried is a literal translation of the bubblediagram into a shape. Circles are a great start for compression-only buildings and therefore might work really well. Then we want to add some qualities in the spaces, such as corridors, free height and optical connections. To do this, we divide the plot in a grid with a lot of points and for each point calculate the \"importance\" of each point of being built. For example, the centre of the circle should have 100% of the height, a point on the edge of the circle has a lower importance and can be built with maybe a 20% height. Points close to a roomconnection should have higher importance, to allow for corridors to exist. When giving the freeheight as an input ( Fig 3 ) all the points in the box are also considered \"more important\". Overall added (with some factors) this gives a heatmap with importances, seen in Fig 4 . This is a potential approach to get an interesting floorplan which might be good for compression-only building. To show the potential we plotted our bubblediagram and moved the points up with x^2 (an approach to cartesian curve, only for presentation purposes) to show how the hammam might look. It was an interesting point of looking at it, but we quickly realized it was never buildable. With only inexperienced builders, we have to come up with something more understandable. Fig. 3: Importance of the bubble diagram Fig. 4: Importance of the hallways Fig. 6: Importance of the free height Fig. 6: Added imporances to an organic shape Fig. 6: An example of our bubblediagram, where imporance is heightened under x^2 We realised that this shape is not optimal, for the reason that unskilled people have to build this. We decided to not futher develop computational ways of getting to a floorplan, and leave computational interventions for later on. However this experiment was far from useless. It gave an iteresting view on how the whole building might look like and gave a better look towards the garden and the open spaces. The next path we took was with the Magnetizing floor plan generator, a plugin that translates bubble diagram into spaces within a boundary. It sounds really interesting to use but had some flaws that made the plugin not suitable for our project. The main flaw is the use of corridors, we planned out 3 \"hallways\" to function as the main places within the building (the entrance, the garden and the hammam hall), but implementing this was super hard. Secondly, the maximum rooms allowed in this plugin is 15, where we have more rooms. Lastly, the plugin doesn't give perfect, usable floorplans, but merely a more interesting to look at floorplan, that is equal to the bubblediagram. Manual shape We decided it made more sense to create the shape by hand, as we explored some computational approaches which didn't gave the results we hoped. This opened the discussion on how we'd develop the grid. From the more classical hammam we saw that round shapes or polygons were commonly used. (For reference check this link ) Also, it would have a kind of elegance that fit well with the hammam where we like to bring some luxury back in the lives of the habitants. From a structural point of view, polygons are quite allright, as they consist out of triangles. This would make it buildable and suitable for compression-only building. So from the topology we'd prefer to have an polygonal grid, more specific a hexogonal grid. The main issue is shown in Fig 5 . Rectangular grids allow for distribution of horizontal forces and to cancel out with the next arch on the grid. This is not really possible with the hexogonal grid. Because of this, from a structural point of view, we'd prefer the rectangular grid. Also; its way easier to design using arches and vaults, seen in the masonry paragraph . Fig. 6: Bubble Diagram of the program of requirements After discussing we decided that topology should be more important and we should try to get it structural buildable, while it doesn't get to complicated. This allows for it to achieve elegance in the design, having a challenge and having hexagons as \"our thing\". On the other hand, if on the end of next week, we dont have it working, we should retry with rectangles. For this it is important to work parralel on the 3d shape and on the dynamic relaxation. Next steps We edited the flowchart to be more fitting of this weeks progress. Mostly it was exploring some ways of approach, as we didnt know what to do exactly. Fig. 6: Bubble Diagram of the program of requirements As previously written, next week is an important one that should determine if a hexogonal grid is reachable, but more important buidable.
