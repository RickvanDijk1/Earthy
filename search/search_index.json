Total numbers of Hammams: 12, one in each district Size of each Hammam: varies, according to population density Layout of Hammams: according to traditional Hammams The location of the hammam should depend on: - Available space - Walking distance (preferable centered in districts) And will have the following attraction points: - Water-reservoirs - Water-treatment - Other recreation/greenery - Topography of the area We analysed the camp on previously described qualities. The map under this text shows the important areas in the camp with several attraction points. These will be the imput for the upcoming analysis.

As stated in week 1 we assume one Hammam per district. Step one in the design is determining the location and the size of the Hammam. Combining the expected size and best locations is therefore the main structure of our flowchart, as shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1: Basic structure of the flowchart in week 2 Location Creating an Hammam in the camp will require some thinking about the location. Already in week 1 we defined the important points where the Hammam should be placed. Density and Walking distance being the most important ones. We created an algorythm to find the best spots for the Hammam, using previously described parameters. Density was calculated with the density map , loaded into the Image Sampler of Grasshopper. The inverse of Density overall means more space to use and less families to bribe/offer alternatives. Walking distance was determined as, the closer to the centre of a district, the better. Also the other attractionpoints have been taken in account. A grid was made for the entire camp and the algorythm gave a result for each point (the higher - better). Now we edited the \"point-system\" to give less results and make it dependend per district. This loop can be seen in the following GIF: Fig. 2: Feedback loop on the filtering of points within each district. The whole location finding can be summarized in the following flowchart. Fig. 3: Flowchart towards finding the locations Size Now we have a lot of possible locations, we need to know the size of the plot to compare with the location and make a PoR. Firstly we analysed the topography of \"Bathhouse\" and how they work, which resulted in some depth charts After reviewing the depth charts and layouts of the bathhouses and other hammam, we chose a \"standard\" Hammam to design with. Fig. 4: Layout and depth charts of several bathhouses For this Hammam we created a depth chart, which became imput for the Bubble Diagram, together with the needed rooms.

We make two different connection: physical and optical connections. The following Bubble diagram presents the pysical connection within the rooms and the sizes of the rooms. Also, optical connections are present, shown in the REL diagram. Fig. 6: Bubble Diagram of the program of requirements Fig. 7: REL Diagram of the program of requirements Combining Now we have some possible locations, but some are not viable to build the Hammam, mostly due to houses standing on the location. Choosing the location is hard to do parametricly, as the house cannot be loaded in. The GIF below shows the chosen location for the districts. We will further continue developing a Hammam in district 10. All locations are chosen to have the less amount of houses removed. Fig. 8: Feedback loop on the filtering of points within each district. Flowchart The flowchart below shows all the processes that took place this week. Its basicly a sum-up of previously described processes. Fig. 9: Total flowchart of week 2 Next steps Week 2 resulted in a base configuration of the building with an suggested location, size and configuration. The next weeks we will continue with formfinding. The main inputs for the next phase should corrospond with the outputs generated in this phase. The Bubble and REL diagrams will provide the inputs for the basic shape. On the side we already generated some knowledge towards the use of masonry in vaults or domes. This is important when creating a grid, generated from the Bubble and REL diagrams. Vault overall support and easier grid and allow for higher free-heights. To adapt the layout to the location and to fit a Hammam, we will have to research the use, noise, routing, sunligt and information about the plot. Then to generate a mesh of the building, knowledge of masonry and load transfer is needed. The previous is also shown in the flowchart below.
