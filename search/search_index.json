This week started off with the The grid To eventually make the translation to a buildable adobe building, we need to look into masonry. Eventually this turned out to be a bit of a chicken-and-egg-problem, as the structures should influence the grid, but the grid should also influence the structures chosen. We decided that the shape, and therefore the grid, is the more important one. Nevertheless we also looked into different kinds of vaults, domes, bricks and sections. The main conclusions about roofs can be found in the following picture: Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes We realised that to achieve a builable building we have to read into these vaults and how they are constructed. Its not only about the end result, but it should also hold mid-construction. Reading into this is also very important. During one of our sessions we also discussed the possibility of digging into the ground to build. It has some good features, shown in Fig 2 . Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes Shape To go from space to shape several paths can be taken to get to a shape and mesh. Several discussions have taken place to get to a basic floorplan and how to get there. This will show some experimenting we did this week to get into designing the hammam. The first approach we tried is a literal translation of the bubblediagram into a shape. Circles are a great start for compression-only buildings and therefore might work really well. Then we want to add some qualities in the spaces, such as corridors, free height and optical connections. To do this, we divide the plot in a grid with a lot of points and for each point calculate the \"importance\" of each point of being built. For example, the centre of the circle should have 100% of the height, a point on the edge of the circle has a lower importance and can be built with maybe a 20% height. Points close to a roomconnection should have higher importance, to allow for corridors to exist. When giving the freeheight as an input ( Fig 3 ) all the points in the box are also considered \"more important\". Overall added (with some factors) this gives a heatmap with importances, seen in Fig 4 . This is a potential approach to get an interesting floorplan which might be good for compression-only building. To show the potential we plotted our bubblediagram and moved the points up with x^2 (an approach to cartesian curve, only for presentation purposes) to show how the hammam might look. It was an interesting point of looking at it, but we quickly realized it was never buildable. With only inexperienced builders, we have to come up with something more understandable. Fig. 3: Importance of the bubble diagram Fig. 4: Importance of the hallways Fig. 6: Importance of the free height Fig. 6: Added imporances to an organic shape Fig. 6: An example of our bubblediagram, where imporance is heightened under x^2 We realised that this shape is not optimal, for the reason that unskilled people have to build this. We decided to not futher develop computational ways of getting to a floorplan, and leave computational interventions for later on. However this experiment was far from useless. It gave an iteresting view on how the whole building might look like and gave a better look towards the garden and the open spaces. The next path we took was with the Magnetizing floor plan generator, a plugin that translates bubble diagram into spaces within a boundary. It sounds really interesting to use but had some flaws that made the plugin not suitable for our project. The main flaw is the use of corridors, we planned out 3 \"hallways\" to function as the main places within the building (the entrance, the garden and the hammam hall), but implementing this was super hard. Secondly, the maximum rooms allowed in this plugin is 15, where we have more rooms. Lastly, the plugin doesn't give perfect, usable floorplans, but merely a more interesting to look at floorplan, that is equal to the bubblediagram. Manual shape We decided it made more sense to create the shape by hand, as we explored some computational approaches which didn't gave the results we hoped. This opened the discussion on how we'd develop the grid. From the more classical hammam we saw that round shapes or polygons were commonly used. (For reference check this link ) Also, it would have a kind of elegance that fit well with the hammam where we like to bring some luxury back in the lives of the habitants. From a structural point of view, polygons are quite allright, as they consist out of triangles. This would make it buildable and suitable for compression-only building. So from the topology we'd prefer to have an polygonal grid, more specific a hexogonal grid. The main issue is shown in Fig 5 . Rectangular grids allow for distribution of horizontal forces and to cancel out with the next arch on the grid. This is not really possible with the hexogonal grid. Because of this, from a structural point of view, we'd prefer the rectangular grid. Also; its way easier to design using arches and vaults, seen in the masonry paragraph . Fig. 6: Bubble Diagram of the program of requirements After discussing we decided that topology should be more important and we should try to get it structural buildable, while it doesn't get to complicated.

As stated in week 1 we assume one Hammam per district. Step one in the design is determining the location and the size of the Hammam. Combining the expected size and best locations is therefore the main structure of our flowchart, as shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1: Basic structure of the flowchart in week 2 Location Creating an Hammam in the camp will require some thinking about the location. Already in week 1 we defined the important points where the Hammam should be placed. Density and Walking distance being the most important ones. We created an algorythm to find the best spots for the Hammam, using previously described parameters. Density was calculated with the density map , loaded into the Image Sampler of Grasshopper. The inverse of Density overall means more space to use and less families to bribe/offer alternatives. Walking distance was determined as, the closer to the centre of a district, the better. Also the other attractionpoints have been taken in account. A grid was made for the entire camp and the algorythm gave a result for each point (the higher - better). Now we edited the \"point-system\" to give less results and make it dependend per district. This loop can be seen in the following GIF: Fig. 2: Feedback loop on the filtering of points within each district. The whole location finding can be summarized in the following flowchart. Fig. 3: Flowchart towards finding the locations Size Now we have a lot of possible locations, we need to know the size of the plot to compare with the location and make a PoR. Firstly we analysed the topography of \"Bathhouse\" and how they work, which resulted in some depth charts After reviewing the depth charts and layouts of the bathhouses and other hammam, we chose a \"standard\" Hammam to design with. Fig. 4: Layout and depth charts of several bathhouses For this Hammam we created a depth chart, which became imput for the Bubble Diagram, together with the needed rooms. Fig. 5: The bubble diagram working with random sizes Program of requirements To estimate the size 5 different historical hammam are analyzed. The Garineh Kohne, Golshan, Dorod, Chekneh and the Kaboli Hammam. The spaces of the mentioned hammams were separated into following functions: dressing room, corridors, hot house, outdoor pool and the subsidiary room. This way we could find out how much percentages of the total floor plan each function requires. This can be seen in the figure \u201crequired space per function analysis_percentages per function\u201d. Since the result is in %, it allows us to separate the estimated hammam size in its different functions and change the room sizes according to the different amount of visitors in each district. As a reference for the general hamam size we took the Zygeheimi Hammam as an example. It has a surface of 400 m2 and it can host 25 to 30 people per hour.

The inverse of Density overall means more space to use and less families to bribe/offer alternatives. Walking distance was determined as, the closer to the centre of a district, the better. Also the other attractionpoints have been taken in account. A grid was made for the entire camp and the algorythm gave a result for each point (the higher - better). Now we edited the \"point-system\" to give less results and make it dependend per district.

The Garineh Kohne, Golshan, Dorod, Chekneh and the Kaboli Hammam. The spaces of the mentioned hammams were separated into following functions: dressing room, corridors, hot house, outdoor pool and the subsidiary room. This way we could find out how much percentages of the total floor plan each function requires. This can be seen in the figure \u201crequired space per function analysis_percentages per function\u201d. Since the result is in %, it allows us to separate the estimated hammam size in its different functions and change the room sizes according to the different amount of visitors in each district.

We will develop ways of going from space - shape. This is a process that can be done on many ways, both manual and computational. This weeks objective is to check these processes and try to get a basic map. The bubble diagram is the input for these processes, as we say this configuration of the rooms is optimal or at least close to the most functional layout of the building. In week 2 we created the expected flowchart for this week. Concluding, this week should be about reading into masonry techniques, some preparations for the brick making and going from space to shape. Masonry To eventually make the translation to a buildable adobe building, we need to look into masonry. Eventually this turned out to be a bit of a chicken-and-egg-problem, as the structures should influence the grid, but the grid should also influence the structures chosen. We decided that the shape, and therefore the grid, is the more important one. Nevertheless we also looked into different kinds of vaults, domes, bricks and sections. The main conclusions about roofs can be found in the following picture: Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes We realised that to achieve a builable building we have to read into these vaults and how they are constructed. Its not only about the end result, but it should also hold mid-construction. Reading into this is also very important. During one of our sessions we also discussed the possibility of digging into the ground to build. It has some good features, shown in Fig 2 . Fig. 1: Possibilities of vaults/domes Shape To go from space to shape several paths can be taken to get to a shape and mesh. Several discussions have taken place to get to a basic floorplan and how to get there. This will show some experimenting we did this week to get into designing the hammam. The first approach we tried is a literal translation of the bubblediagram into a shape. Circles are a great start for compression-only buildings and therefore might work really well. Then we want to add some qualities in the spaces, such as corridors, free height and optical connections. To do this, we divide the plot in a grid with a lot of points and for each point calculate the \"importance\" of each point of being built. For example, the centre of the circle should have 100% of the height, a point on the edge of the circle has a lower importance and can be built with maybe a 20% height. Points close to a roomconnection should have higher importance, to allow for corridors to exist. When giving the freeheight as an input ( Fig 3 ) all the points in the box are also considered \"more important\". Overall added (with some factors) this gives a heatmap with importances, seen in Fig 4 . This is a potential approach to get an interesting floorplan which might be good for compression-only building. To show the potential we plotted our bubblediagram and moved the points up with x^2 (an approach to cartesian curve, only for presentation purposes) to show how the hammam might look. It was an interesting point of looking at it, but we quickly realized it was never buildable. With only inexperienced builders, we have to come up with something more understandable. Fig. 3: Importance of the bubble diagram Fig. 4: Importance of the hallways Fig. 6: Importance of the free height Fig. 6: Added imporances to an organic shape Fig. 6: An example of our bubblediagram, where imporance is heightened under x^2 We realised that this shape is not optimal, for the reason that unskilled people have to build this. We decided to not futher develop computational ways of getting to a floorplan, and leave computational interventions for later on. However this experiment was far from useless. It gave an iteresting view on how the whole building might look like and gave a better look towards the garden and the open spaces. The next path we took was with the Magnetizing floor plan generator, a plugin that translates bubble diagram into spaces within a boundary. It sounds really interesting to use but had some flaws that made the plugin not suitable for our project. The main flaw is the use of corridors, we planned out 3 \"hallways\" to function as the main places within the building (the entrance, the garden and the hammam hall), but implementing this was super hard. Secondly, the maximum rooms allowed in this plugin is 15, where we have more rooms. Lastly, the plugin doesn't give perfect, usable floorplans, but merely a more interesting to look at floorplan, that is equal to the bubblediagram. We tried the plugin with the boundary and that gave around 20 different configurations. These gave very interesting insights in the building and how we should (and or could) configurate the building. Fig. 7: Possible configurations by the Magnetizing floor plan tool Fig. 8: 4 combinations, from which 2 were rendered without corridors What can we learn from these 2 computational approaches? First of all these gave optional designs of our Hammam, which is always a nice start. But we did not do these approaches with this reasoning. The first approach was really experimental and might not create an easy-to-build building, but it made us think about how you could design with compression-only building. The result was not usable, but it gave a clear view on how the garden could be used. The building would become a bit of 2 buildings in one with a garden inbetween. The second thing we saw was that having a lot of solo \"iglos\" could give a nice view, but it's very messy and this might not reflect original Hammam well. From the magnetizing tool we learned what was a logical by computer to divide the building. This was done with rectangles, from which we all realised it was not conform the topology. Also, when looking at the figure 7 , all of the configurations have a corridor around the garden. This might be an interesting feature of the building that we'd like to use in the building. So concluding: The garden should be the glue inbetween 2 functions Look into roofing and don't create 15 different \"iglos\" Create a corridor around the garden Manual shape We decided it made more sense to create the shape by hand, as we explored some computational approaches which didn't gave the results we hoped. This opened the discussion on how we'd develop the grid. From the more classical hammam we saw that round shapes or polygons were commonly used. (For reference check this link ) Also, it would have a kind of elegance that fit well with the hammam where we like to bring some luxury back in the lives of the habitants. From a structural point of view, polygons are quite allright, as they consist out of triangles. This would make it buildable and suitable for compression-only building. So from the topology we'd prefer to have an polygonal grid, more specific a hexogonal grid. The main issue is shown in Fig 9 . Rectangular grids allow for distribution of horizontal forces and to cancel out with the next arch on the grid. This is not really possible with the hexogonal grid. Because of this, from a structural point of view, we'd prefer the rectangular grid. Also; its way easier to design using arches and vaults, seen in the masonry paragraph . Fig. 9: The use of more arches (Joffroy, 1994) After discussing we decided that topology should be more important and we should try to get it structural buildable, while it doesn't get to complicated. This allows for it to achieve elegance in the design, having a challenge and having hexagons as \"our thing\". On the other hand, if on the end of next week, we dont have it working, we should retry with rectangles. For this it is important to work parralel on the 3d shape and on the dynamic relaxation. Brick making This week also contained the brick making. We have a seperate page about this. See this page Next steps We edited the flowchart to be more fitting of this weeks progress. This week we saw two ways of configuration that were done computational. We also researched a lot into masonry, which will influence the shape.

We already had some shapes but weren't fully convinced yet. Slowly into the week, we saw that a triangular grid was achievable and we focussed more on the shape. Therefore, there will be no more talks and comparisons about rectangles and we go all-in on the hexagons. We developed the grid into the final shape, where each edge equals 1.2 meters. This way, the triangles could be combined into corridors, while remaining more than a meter wide (to be precise 1.04m ). Fig. 2: Reasons for the grid Shape Now that we have the grid concluded, we started making configurations of the mesh. We drew a lot of configurations, the most important are posted below chronologically. Ohter pictures will be linked in this page aswell. We will experiment with the hexagons and try to come up with different configurations of the building. Fig. 3: Configuration 1 The first configuration we used the hexagons that are enlarged, to ensure corridor areas can be implemented. We really liked this \"superman\" shape and tried experimenting with it. Following the bubble diagram this configuration we also tried to get a more compact shape. Making rooms all around the garden. Fig. 4: Configuration 2 The configuration above is one that became from some other configurations which follow the same ideas. Check this picture that was the first try. This picture and this drawing were other configurations that led to Fig 3 . Also we learned a lot from these configurations on how to handle the flexibility of the garden and how the \"superman\" shape can be used. Another approach was tried afterwards. In stead of focussing on hexagons, we tried designing with triangles. Where the hexagon is still the basis of the shapes, more triangles are added to fill the building. Figure 5 came from this drawing . Fig. 5: Configuration 3, based on triangles We already designed on a lower scale, where the hexagons can be subdivided within the grid. Also this lower scale allowed for more private connections between rooms and it allows for more typology of the hammam, especially in the hothouse. Some other variants of this design were this drawing and this drawing , where we focussed on more compacht building and tried some configurations. Design rules (\"the game\") As we were designing from our own head, certainly not well structured, so we decided to try another approach. We will develop a ruleset that contains all the bare minimum boundaries of the design. When we have these rules, we can create a strategy to design everything. We believe that there is not one perfect design, but if we follow the rules, we would have a more-than-sufficient building, or better. The rules we came up with are as follows: ADD THE GALLERY Next steps Now that we have the rules, next week will start with coming up with a strategy conform these rules. Technically, every design that follows the rules should be a good and viable design, but we expect that it takes a few more tries.

Fig. 4: Configuration 2 The configuration above is one that became from some other configurations which follow the same ideas. Check this picture that was the first try. This picture and this drawing were other configurations that led to Fig 3 . Also we learned a lot from these configurations on how to handle the flexibility of the garden and how the \"superman\" shape can be used. Another approach was tried afterwards. In stead of focussing on hexagons, we tried designing with triangles. Where the hexagon is still the basis of the shapes, more triangles are added to fill the building. Figure 5 came from this drawing . Fig. 5: Configuration 3, based on triangles We already designed on a lower scale, where the hexagons can be subdivided within the grid. Also this lower scale allowed for more private connections between rooms and it allows for more typology of the hammam, especially in the hothouse. Some other variants of this design were this drawing and this drawing , where we focussed on more compacht building and tried some configurations.","title":"Shape"},{"location":"week4/#design-rules-the-game","text":"As we were designing from our own head, certainly not well structured, so we decided to try another approach. We will develop a ruleset that contains all the bare minimum boundaries of the design. When we have these rules, we can create a strategy to design everything. We believe that there is not one perfect design, but if we follow the rules, we would have a more-than-sufficient building, or better. The rules we came up with are as follows: ADD THE GALLERY","title":"Design rules (\"the game\")"},{"location":"week4/#next-steps","text":"Now that we have the rules, next week will start with coming up with a strategy conform these rules. Technically, every design that follows the rules should be a good and viable design, but we expect that it takes a few more tries.

This week started off with the choosing a final strategy that follows the rules we wrote. Then we finish some overall things and have our mid-terms on thursday. This week we will create a strategy, choose it and continue towards a 3D shape. We will have to add dynamic relaxation and a structure definition to our project. Also this week is the mid-terms. This is the proposed flowchart for this week: Fig. 1: This weeks flowchart Our strategy Fig. 2: We added the rules to our grid and developed a design Figure 2 shows the sketch we made that we felt comfortable with. It contained all the needed rules and looked promising. The garden with the stoa around can be a super beautiful place and the walktrough the building was convincing as well. Eventually we made the following layout out of this sketch: Fig. 3: Our final layout The entrance is on the north-west and contains access to the washing areas, as well as to the garden. Around the garden the stoa is the main feature in the building. We also want to develop this stoa to look super nice, by the use of dynamic relaxation. The Hammam has an obvious degree of privateness, where the route starts at the dressing-rooms. Via the hall and the tea room, people come at the hothouse, with connections to the pools and private areas. The childcare has been seperated by the long closed wall to form a barrier between the two functions. The following GIF shows the layout being made by following our rules: Fig. 4: The making of the layout How will we build this? As the building is fully constructed by hexagons, we can easily create domes on top of them. It is also our idea to build almost all the domes by their own, using \"simple\" domes. We will create a \"guide\" on how to build a dome from a hexagon, the building should then look like this: Fig. 5: The domes of the Hammam We want to build a scale model ourselves of this kind of dome, to experience how building this is. The guide should focus on how unskilled people can build it safely and easy. Therefore our domes aren't really interesting and challenging to design. To counter this, we decided to make some things a bit more challenging. Previously was told that the stoa has an important role in the Hammam. It holds everyhing together and can be a pleasing to be place. Therefore we will relax this shape and design in computationally. It will be a nice to look at as it is mathematical logically. Together with the vaults and stoa our Hammam should look like this (take not this is the ceilings, not the roofs): Fig. 5: The vaults and stoa of the Hammam Fig. 5: The final look of the Hammam Also, to challenge us in the compression-only building we will make a piece of the Hammam more challenging. Ignoring that people have to make it, we can experiment a bit more with compression-only buildings. The yellow parts on Figure 6 show the dome we want to experiment with and some pieces of the stoa that require extra detailing. Fig. 6: Our structural challenge/span Brick testing This week also contained the brick testing. We have a seperate page about this. See this page Next steps After the midterms we enter the structuring phase. We start by improving our tesselations and start by making the whole models of the hammam. We will do this in 3 pieces. The stoa first will be developed and dynamic relaxed. All the domes are developed by a rulebook that work for all the domes. Lastly the structural challenge requires some more detailing.
